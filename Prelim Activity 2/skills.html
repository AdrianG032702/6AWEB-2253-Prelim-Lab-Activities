      <p class="profile-text">
       I’m a Web Developer student from Holy Angel University, and I’ve grown genuinely fascinated with how ideas can turn into real, working websites.
       Over time, I’ve been exploring both the creative and technical sides of web development. Learning how design, logic, and problem-solving all come together.
       I enjoy experimenting with different tools and approaches, especially when building projects that challenge me to think differently. Each new skill feels like a step forward in my journey.
       My long-term goal is to become a full-stack developer who can build complete, reliable, and meaningful digital experiences from the ground up.
